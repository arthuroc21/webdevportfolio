# Rock Paper Scissors Web Application

Hi!  

This was one of my assessment tasks for the IT course I'm taking this year. The task was to develop a rock paper scissors web game that you could choose between
playing with someone else or alone (in that case your oponent would be the computer) and you could choose the number of rounds.  
  
This folder contains the html and css files, as well some images for the game, an application manual, and I added some mock up images that I did before developing the game, just so I had 
a visual preview of the application.  
  
Let me know if you have any question or if you have some tip to improve the application!  
  
Thanks!
